# Facer
Using OpenCv and Python Haar Cascade Algorithm is used to detect and recognize faces.

The project contain three basic codes.Which are:

1.sample.py : which is used to take sample of the user face such that it can train with it. In this project i have taken 20 sample faces of
              each user.
2.train.py: This is used for training the sample images using pillow and numpy and haar cascade algorithm
3.recognize.py: This is used for recognizing the user face by including the trained sample(trainner.yml) and haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml file
